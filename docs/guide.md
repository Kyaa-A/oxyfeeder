# Your Document Playbook: When to Call Each File

---

## 1. system_research.md

**Think of this as:** The “Project Bible” or the “Scientific Foundation.”  
**Core Purpose:** Explains the fundamental *why* and the core operational logic of the project, based on the original research.  
**When to Call It:**  
- When you need to generate high-level summaries or introductory text (like for a README.md).  
- When onboarding a new team member and want the AI to explain the project's purpose.  
- When brainstorming a major new feature and ensuring it aligns with the project's core objectives.  

**Example Prompt:**  
> "Generate a README for the firmware folder. Use the core concepts from @docs/system_research.md to explain the system's input-process-output logic and its main purpose."

## 2. create-prd.md (Product Requirements Document)

**Think of this as:** The “Feature Blueprint” or the “User’s Wishlist.”  
**Core Purpose:** Defines what the final product should do from a user’s perspective — includes all features, user stories, and success metrics.  
**When to Call It (Very Frequently):**  
- When building any UI (most common use case).  
- When implementing the logic for a specific feature (e.g., alerts).  
- When writing test cases to verify a feature works as expected.  

**Example Prompt:**  
> "Based on the Key Features and User Stories in @docs/create-prd.md, create the UI for the 'Settings' screen. It needs controls for setting the feeding schedule and the low-oxygen alert threshold."

## 3. hardware-overview.md

**Think of this as:** The “System Architecture Map.”  
**Core Purpose:** Explains how all major hardware components connect and communicate at a high level.  
**When to Call It:**  
- When writing the communication protocol between the Arduino and the ESP32.  
- When creating data models (classes) in your Flutter app to represent data coming from the device.  
- When debugging issues where one part of the system isn’t talking to another.  

**Example Prompt:**  
> "Using the signal flow diagram described in @docs/hardware-overview.md, write a Dart class named OxyFeederStatus that can model the complete data packet sent from the ESP32 to the Flutter app."

## 4. sensor-list.md

**Think of this as:** The “Technical Spec Sheet.”  
**Core Purpose:** Provides specific, low-level technical details for each sensor (voltage, interface, etc.).  
**When to Call It:**  
- When writing the actual firmware code to read data from a specific sensor.  
- When you need to know which pin to connect a sensor to.  
- When debugging inaccurate sensor readings and need to check the specs.  

**Example Prompt:**  
> "I'm writing the Arduino code to read from the Gravity DO Sensor. Using the details from @docs/sensor-list.md, provide the complete function to read the analog value and convert it to an mg/L reading. Reference the correct voltage for the sensor."

## 5. power-system.md

**Think of this as:** The “Energy and Safety Guide.”  
**Core Purpose:** Explains how the system is powered and what safety measures are in place.  
**When to Call It:**  
- When writing firmware code to monitor battery voltage.  
- When implementing low-power or battery-saving features.  
- When creating the battery status UI in the Flutter app.  

**Example Prompt:**  
> "Based on the safety recommendations in @docs/power-system.md, write the firmware logic that sends a 'Low Battery' alert when voltage drops below 11.5V and then puts the device into deep sleep mode to protect the battery."

## 6. generate-task.md & process-task-list.md

**Think of these as:** “Project Management Docs.”  
**Core Purpose:** Help you and your team stay organized. These are less frequently used for generating *application code.*  
**When to Call It:**  
- When you want the AI to act as a project manager.  

**Example Prompt:**  
> "Review @docs/generate-task.md and tell me what the next three tasks are for the 'Flutter Dev' role. Provide a brief summary of each."
